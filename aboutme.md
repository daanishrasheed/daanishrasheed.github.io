My name is Daanish Rasheed. In college, I explored many fields within the tech industry, 
however, when I discovered the world of data, it had peaked my interest unlike anything
I have ever studied for. Seeing how data can be dealt with in so many different ways to make
a multitude of very reliable applications, looking for a career in this field became my
primary goal. I became particularly interested in the deep learning applications that can
be created, where not just numbers, but images, text and audio is also taken into account.
