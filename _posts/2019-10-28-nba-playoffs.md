The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional men’s basketball league in North America, made up of thirty teams(29 within the U.S. and one in Canada). It is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues within the USA and Canada.

The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). It changed its name to the National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League(NBL). The NBA’s regular season runs from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. Its playoffs extend into June.

Through a zip file found on the Carnegie Mellon website, which has data on every professional NBA player since 1946, I was able to make inferences on the coherency that an NBA athlete’s performance in the regular season, has with their performance in the postseason (playoffs). Because of many rule changes that have occurred through the years, I am only looking at players that played starting in 1985.
